# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created to explore and document the concepts, activities, and importance of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It aims to provide a foundational understanding for students, developers, and project stakeholders who are involved in building quality software systems.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders for a software system. It acts as the foundation for software design and development.

### Importance in SDLC:
- Ensures the software meets client and user expectations.
- Reduces the risk of costly changes during development.
- Provides a clear scope and guidelines for development and testing teams.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clarifies Project Scope**  
   It helps define what the system should and shouldnâ€™t do, preventing scope creep and misunderstandings.

2. **Enhances Communication**  
   It aligns developers, testers, stakeholders, and clients with a shared understanding of the software goals.

3. **Improves Quality and Reduces Costs**  
   Early detection of issues saves time and money during the development and testing phases.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting initial requirements from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Using techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops to dig deeper into stakeholder needs.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Structuring and recording the requirements in documents or models.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing requirements for clarity, feasibility, and modeling them for better understanding.
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that documented requirements are correct and reflect stakeholder intentions.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Users can create and manage bookings.
- Admins can approve or reject bookings.
- System sends email confirmation after booking.

### Non-functional Requirements
These define how the system should perform.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- The system must load the booking form within 2 seconds.
- Must be accessible on mobile and desktop devices.
- The system should be available 99.9% of the time.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system (use cases).

### Benefits:
- Simple and intuitive for stakeholder understanding.
- Useful in identifying system functionality.
- Acts as a reference for developers and testers.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable by the user or client.

### Importance:
- Provides measurable goals.
- Aligns developer and stakeholder expectations.
- Acts as a basis for test cases.

### Example for Checkout Feature:
- User must be logged in to access the checkout.
- User must confirm booking details before payment.
- Payment confirmation must be displayed within 5 seconds.
- A confirmation email must be sent after successful payment.
